# Speech Processing Projects

The repository consists of speech based projects.

## Project
Classification of musical instruments from their sounds.
Extracted multiple spectral and temporal features from each audio sample of the IRMAS dataset
◦ Employed VQ codebook matching algorithm and neural networks toward the classification task
◦ Achieved an accuracy of 65.05% with neural networks model on 11 classes of musical instruments

## Assignment 1A
Generation of vowels using source filter model, along with implementation of IIR Filter.

## Assignment 1B
Using the STFT (Short Term Fourier Transform) method in order to observe the formant frequencies present in the audio.

## Assignment 2 
Using LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) method for analysis of speech signal, observing the formants, and for pitch detection.
